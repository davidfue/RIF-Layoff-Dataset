# Glossary

## This section provides a shared vocabulary in the context of Reduction in Force actions across the federal government and related personnel processes. These definitions draw from federal sources like the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and support accurate interpretation of our CSV schema, which standardizes how we capture and format RIF-related data. Use this glossary as a reference when reviewing our schema fields. 

## What is a Reduction in Force?

### Reduction in Force (RIF): occurs when an agency must eliminate positions due to factors such as lack of work, budget constraints, reorganizations, or personnel ceiling limits. Under federal regulations, a RIF must be carried out when an employee is separated, demoted, furloughed for more than 30 consecutive days, or reassigned in a way that displaces others – and the reason is due to: lack of work, shortage of funds, reorganization, loss of function, or classification changes following job erosion. 

### Both the action and reason must meet these criteria for RIF procedures to apply. (Source: OPM Workforce Reshaping Operations Handbook, Chapter III Section C)

### A RIF differs from performance-based terminations and is often tied to broader structural or policy decisions.

## How does a RIF differ from voluntary separation?

### Voluntary Separation: Resignations, retirements, or changes to lower grade that are employee-initiated; differs from a RIF – which is a involuntary, mandatory separation that are agency-initiated (Source: OPM Workforce Reshaping Operations Handbook, Chapter I Section C)

## How does a RIF differ from a layoff?

### Layoff: In the federal government, layoff is an informal term often used to describe job loss due to organizational or budgetary changes. However, the official term is Reduction in Force, which refers to a formal, regulated process for workforce downsizing governed by Office of Personnel Management rules. Unlike private-sector layoffs, RIFs involve legal rules for retention standing, veterans’ preference, and reassignment rights. 

## What is the difference between capacity and capability?

### Capacity (Headcount): The number of personnel available to deliver government services

### Capability (Functionality): The skills, knowledge, and expertise available to deliver specialized government services 

## What is the difference between planned and unplanned workforce reductions? 

### Planned Reduction: Strategically scheduled reduction, often accompanied by programs like Voluntary Early Retirement Authority, Voluntary Separation Incentive Payment, reassignments, or hiring freezes (Source: OPM) 

### Unplanned Reduction: Unexpected or urgent downsizing triggered by unforeseen events
